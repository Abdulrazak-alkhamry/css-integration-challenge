## The challenge

As often with CSS, this is an exercise in precision and accuracy (and a zest of dementia, because... CSS).

For each interface there is:

- A standard html page.
- A standard style.css sheet
- The relevant html and css code so that the end result looks exactly as the provided *high-fidelity mockup* images.
